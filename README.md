# Conditional plasticity

This repo includes both the `typst` and `latex` versions of my article on some
cute results in the theory of Banach space geometry. The `typst` version is
the original and likely has fewer typos, and it looks generally nicer.

The `latex` version can be found on the arxiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09245.

There is also a funny *ad hoc* shotgun parsing file `parsy.py` that was used
to aid conversion of `typst` to `latex`, since `pandoc` was insufficient
at the time of conversion.
