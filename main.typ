== Conventions, notation <sec:main_notation>

Throughout @sec:main, we consider the following structure and certain weakenings thereof, explained below:
- $n$ is a fixed value in $NN$ such that $n >= 1$.
- $X_i$ is a family of strictly convex nontrivial Banach spaces, indexed by $i in [n]$.
- $B_i, S_i$ are the unit ball and sphere of $X_i$ respectively.
- $Z = plus.circle.big_(i in [n]) X_i$ is the direct sum of the family $X_i$ endowed with the $infinity$-norm, i.e. if $z = (x_0, dots, x_(n-1)) in Z$, then $norm(z) = max_(i in [n]) norm(x_i)$.
- $pi_i : Z -> X_i$ is the projection onto the $i$-th component of $Z$. We will sometimes write $z_i$ for $pi_i z$ when this is unambiguous.
- More generally, $pi_i$ should be understood as the projection onto the $i$-th component of _any_ structure with components indexed by a set containing $i$.
- $pih_i : Z -> hat(X)_i$ is the complementary projection of the $i$-th component, where $hat(X)_i = plus.big.circle_(j in [n] \\ {i} )X_j$. For all $j in [n] \\ i$, we have that $pi_j z = pi_j pih_i z$, and $pi_i pih_i z$ is ill-defined.
- $B_Z, S_Z$ are the unit ball and sphere of $Z$ respectively.
- $E subset.eq B_Z$ is the set of extreme points in $B_Z$. This can be shown to be those $z in S_Z$ for which $forall i in [n], z_i in S_i$.
- $ihom : B_Z -> B_Z$ is a non-contractive injection from $B_Z$ to itself.
- $lip : B_Z -> B_Z$ is a 1-Lipschitz bijection, such that $lip = ihom^(-1)$ if $ihom$ is invertible.
- $sigma : [n] -> [n]$ is a permutation of $[n]$.
- $g_i : S_i -> S_sigma(i)$ is a non-contractive injection satisfying $pi_i x in S_i => ihom(x)_sigma(i) = ihom_i (pi_i x)$. Proving that such functions exist is one of the central results of this article.
- $lip_i : S_sigma(i) -> S_i$ is the inverse of $ihom_i$, whenever the inverse exists.

Many of our results require no geometric considerations, and thus can be carried out on an analogous graph structure:

- $B_i$ is a disconnected graph with maximal vertex degree exactly 1. This means every connected component of $B_i$ consists of either a single vertex or two vertices joined by an edge.
- $S_i <= B_i$ is the subgraph of $B_i$ consisting only of vertices with a neighbor.
- $B_*$ is the co-normal product of the graphs $B_i$, while $B_square$ is the Cartesian product of the same. $B_square$ is a subgraph of $B_*$. Their common set of vertices is denoted $B$.
- $E$ is the set of those vertices $e in B$ for which $forall i in [n], e_i in S_i$. $E_* <= B_*$ and $E_square <= B_square$ are the respective induced subgraphs.
- $S$ is the set of those vertices $s in B$ for which $exists i in [n], s_i in S_i$. $S_* <= B_*$ and $S_square <= B_square$ are the respective induced subgraphs.
- The adjacency of vertices $u,v in B_*$ is denoted $u adj v$, and adjacency in $B_square$ is denoted $u adj' v$.
- The adjacency of vertices $u,v in B_i$ is denoted either $u adj v$ or $u adj' v$, since the two product structures agree on $B_i$.
- $ihom : B_star -> B_star$ is an injective graph homomorphism.
- $lip : B_star -> B_star$ is the set-theoretic inverse of $ihom$ whenever $ihom$ is invertible.
- $ihom_i : S_i -> S_sigma(i)$ is a local isomorphism satisfying $pi_i x in S_i => ihom(x)_sigma(i) = ihom_i (pi_i x)$.
- $lip_i : S_sigma(i) -> S_i$ is the set-theoretic inverse of $ihom_i$, whenever this exists.

The analogies in notation between the Banach space structure and the graph structure are motivated by these identifications:
- Given points $a,b in B_i$ with $B_i$ the unit ball of $X_i$, we may construct the graph $B_i$ by setting $a adj b$ iff $norm(a-b) = 2$. This will be a disconnected graph with maximal vertex degree exactly 1.
- $B_*$ is the graph constructed from $B_Z$ with precisely the same condition for adjacency, while $B_square$ has the adjacency condition $u adj v <=> exists i in [n], (norm(u_i - v_i) = 2) and (pih_i u = pih_i v$).
- Each subgraph $S_i$ of $B_i$ is generated by the unit sphere of $B_i$. Analogously, $S,E$ are the vertex sets corresponding to the unit sphere $S_Z$, and the extreme points of $B_Z$, respectively.

The remaining analogies are left for the reader to verify.

Throughout @sec:main, every theorem and lemma shall have an annotation indicating whether it requires the Banach space structure. If the graph theoretic structure is sufficient, there will be no annotation.

#let bcn = $B_*$
#let bbox = $B_square$

We would like to prove the following theorem:

#theorem[Let $ihom : bcn -> bcn$ be an injective homomorphism. Then there exists a permutation $sigma: [n]->[n]$ and a family of local isomorphisms $g_i : S_i -> S_(sigma(i))$ such that for all $x in bcn$ and all $i in [n]$, we have $x_i in S_i => pi_(sigma(i))ihom(x) = ihom_i (pi_i x)$.] <thm:factors>

#lemma[
  A clique of $2^n-1$ points in $bcn$ has at most one extension
to a clique of $2^n$ points.
] <lem:clique-ext>

#proof[
  Induction on $n$. The case with $n=1$ is clear by inspection.

  First note that if the statement is true for a graph $bcn$, then the maximal clique size for $bcn$ is at most $2^n$. If there were a clique of $2^n+1$ points, then every subclique of size $2^n - 1$ would have at least two distinct extensions to a clique of size $2^n$.

  Consider an enumerated family $(x_i)_(i in [2^n])$ of pairwise adjacent
  vertices in $bcn$. We want to show that any vertex $q in bcn$ that is
  adjacent to all vertices $x_i$ with $i > 0$ is equal to $x_0$.

  Partition the family into $C union.dot D$ such that $C$ is any maximal
  subset of the family such that $pi_0 C$ is an edgeless graph.

  Note two things: $pi_0 D$ is also edgeless, and $card(C) = card(D) = 2^(n-1)$. From this, it follows that $D$ also satisfies the defining condition of $C$.

  Let's verify the first observation. If any element $pi_0 x$ of $pi_0 D$ were disconnected from $pi_0 C$, then $C$ could be extended to $C union {x}$, so $C$ would not be maximal. This implies that every element of $pi_0 D$ is connected to some element of $pi_0 C$, so $pi_0 D subset.eq N(pi_0 C)$. Since $pi_0 C$ is edgeless, then $N(pi_0 C)$ is edgeless,
  thus $pi_0 D$ is edgeless.

  Now the second observation. Since $C$ is maximal among those subsets $S$ for which $pi_0 S$ is edgeless, and $pi_0 D$ is edgeless, we have $card(C) >= card(D)$, from which $card(C) >= 2^(n-1)$. Now, since $forall c, c' in C, c adj c'$ while $pi_0 c adj.not pi_0 c'$, we must have $pih_0 c adj pih_0 c'$. This means that $pih_0 C$ is a clique of at least $card(C) >= 2^(n-1)$ points in $pih_0 bcn$ (we have that $card(pih_0 C) = card(C)$ since $c != c' => c adj c' => pih_0 c adj pih_0 c' => pih_0 c != pih_0 c'$). By the induction assumption, the largest clique size in $pih_0 bcn$ is at most $2^(n-1)$, so $card(C) >= 2^(n-1) >= card(pih_0 C) = card(C)$, hence $card(C) = 2^(n-1)$.

  Having shown that $D$ is also maximal w.r.t. C's defining condition, we have that $pi_0 C subset.eq N(pi_0 D)$. Since $N^2(S) subset.eq S$ for a subset $S$ of a graph of maximal degree 1, we have that $N(pi_0 C) subset.eq pi_0 D$, from which $pi_0 D = N(pi_0 C)$ and $pi_0 C = N(pi_0 D)$.

  Assume WLOG that $x_0 in C$. If $pi_0 q$ had no edge to $pi_0 D$, then
  $pih_0 D union.dot {pih_0 q}$ would form a clique of $2^(n-1)+1$ elements
  in $pih_0 bcn$, which is impossible. Thus $pi_0 q adj pi_0 b$ for some $b in D$. It follows that $pi_0 q$ has no edge to $pi_0 C$, from which $pih_0 q$ has edges to all members of $pih_0 (C - {x_0})$. This means $pih_0 (C - {x_0})$ is a clique of $2^(n-1)-1$ points in $pih_0 bcn$ which can be extended by $pih_0 q$ or by $pih_0 x_0$. By the induction assumption, this means $pih_0 q = pih_0 x_0$.
  
  Running the same argument by some index $j > 0$, we also have that $pih_j q = pih_j x_0$. Since these two projections cover all components, we must have $q = x_0$.

#let xfam = $(x_i)_(i in [2^n])$
#let yfam = $(y_i)_(i in [2^n])$

From here on, let $x_0 in E$. Let $xfam = T(x_0)$ and define $y_i = ihom(x_i)$.


#lemma[
  $ihom$ is an $E_square$-homomorphism.
  ] <one-component>

#proof[
  Let us have $x_a, x_b in E$ such that $x_a adj' x_b$. Then there exists some $x_0 in E$ for which $x_a, x_b in T(x_0)$ --- we may choose $x_0 := x_a$.

  Since $ihom$ is a $bcn$-homomorphism and $x_a adj x_b$, we have $y_a adj y_b$, so $y_a, y_b$ are adjacent in at least one component. Note also that $yfam$ is a clique in $bcn$.

  We first show that $y_a, y_b$ differ in exactly one component.
  Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $y_a, y_b$ differ in at least two components, and let the first two of these have indices $i, j$.

  Let $C_i union.dot D_i$ be a partition of $yfam$ such that $pi_i C_i$ is maximal and edgeless, and $y_a in C_i, y_b in D_i$. To prove that such a partition exists, it is sufficient to find any $y_c$ such that $pi_i y_c adj pi_i y_b$, start with ${y_a, y_c} subset.eq C_i$ and extend $C_i$ to maximality (noting that $pi_i y_a != pi_i y_b$ implies $pi_i y_a adj.not pi_i y_c$). Such a $y_c$ exists, since any partition of $yfam$ into two maximal $pi_i$â€‘edgeless sets consists of two nonempty sets, one of which contains $y_b$, and any member of the other component can be $y_c$.
  Also construct an analogous partition $C_j union.dot D_j$ for $pi_j$.

  Let $k$ be the index for which $pi_k x_a adj pi_k x_b$. By the definition of $T$, this is the unique index at which $pi_k x_a != pi_k x_b$, so $pih_k x_a = pih_k x_b$. Fix $v in B$ such
  that $pih_k v = pih_k x_a, pih_k x_b$, and $pi_k v != pi_k x_a, pi_k x_b$. Note that $ihom(v)$ has $bcn$-edges to all of $yfam$ except possibly for $y_a, y_b$.

  Suppose that $pi_i ihom(v)$ has an edge to $pi_i C_i$. This implies $pi_i ihom(v) in N(pi_i C_i) = pi_i D_i$,
  // ref here?
  from which $pih_i ihom(v)$ forms a $bcn$-clique with $pih_i (D_i - {y_b})$. By @lem:clique-ext this implies that $pih_i ihom(v) = pih_i y_b$, from which $pi_j ihom(v) = pi_j y_b$. From this, we have that $pih_j ihom(v)$ forms a $bcn$-clique with $pih_j (D_j - {y_b})$, which implies by @lem:clique-ext that $pih_j ihom(v) = pih_j y_b$. Since $pih_i ihom(v) = pih_i y_b$ and $pih_j ihom(v) = pih_j y_b$, we have $ihom(v) = y_b = ihom(x_b)$, from which $v = x_b$, which contradicts our choice of $v$.

  Consequently, $pi_i ihom(v)$ has no edge to $pi_i C_i$, and by symmetrical argument it has no edge to $pi_i D_i$ either. From these, we have that $pih_i ihom(v)$ forms a $bcn$-clique with $pih_i (C_i - {y_a})$ and with $pih_i (B_i - {y_b})$, which implies by @lem:clique-ext that $pih_i y_a = pih_i ihom(v) = pih_i y_b$, so $pi_j y_a = pi_j y_b$, contradicting our choice of $j$ and thus our claim that $y_a, y_b$ differ in at least two components.

  Since $y_a$ and $y_b$ are adjacent in at least one component and differ in at most one component, these bounds must be saturated and exactly one component accounts for both, which is some $m$ at which $pi_(m) y_a adj pi_(m) y_b$ and $pih_(m) y_a = pih_(m) y_b$ --- consequently $y_a adj' y_b$.
]

#lemma[
  There is a permutation $sigma: [n]->[n]$ and a family of local isomorphisms $ihom_i : S_i -> S_sigma(i)$ such that for $e in E$, we have $pi_sigma(i) ihom(e) = ihom_i (pi_i e)$.
]

#proof[
First, note that $yfam$ is a subgraph of $T(y_0)$, since $yfam$ is connected (on account of being a homomorphic image of $T(x_0)$), and $T(y_0)$ is the connected component of $y_0$ in $bbox$. Consequently, $ihom$ is a homomorphism from $T(x_0)$ to $T(y_0)$.

Because $ihom$ is an injective homomorphism between the finite graphs $T(x_0)$
and $T(y_0)$, and the two graphs have an equal number of edges, $ihom$ must be an isomorphism from $T(x_0)$ to $T(y_0)$.

That this isomorphism arises from a componentwise isomorphism (up to permutation of components) follows from e.g. Theorem 6.8 in @handbook.

Since these isomorphisms must glue compatibly across all of $E$, we have that there exists a permutation $sigma : [n] -> [n]$ and a family of local isomorphisms $ihom_i : S_i -> S_sigma(i)$ such that for all $x in E$, $pi_sigma(i) ihom(x) = ihom_i (pi_i x)$.
]

We would like to extend this slightly to the case of vertices outside of $E$ to finish our proof of @thm:factors.

#lemma[
  Let $q in B$ and $i in [n]$ be such that $pi_i q = pi_i x_0$. Then $pi_sigma(i) ihom(q) = pi_sigma(i) ihom(x_0) = ihom_i (pi_i x_0)$.
  ] <lem:interior>

#proof[
  This is trivial for the $n=1$ case (since then $q in E$ or the claim is vacuous), so we will assume $n > 1$.

  Let $(x_j)_(j in J)$ be the subfamily of $xfam$ for that satisfies $forall j in J, pi_i x_j adj pi_i x_0$. We then have that $card(J) = 2^(n-1)$ and $forall j in J, pi_sigma(i)y_j adj pi_sigma(i) y_0$. Note also that since $q adj x_j$, we have $ihom(q) adj y_j$ for each $j in J$.

  Suppose that $pi_(sigma(i)) ihom(q) != pi_(sigma(i)) y_0$. This implies that $pi_sigma(i)ihom(q) adj.not pi_sigma(i)y_j$ for each $j in J$, from which (by way of $ihom(q) adj y_j$) we must have $pih_sigma(i)ihom(q) adj pih_sigma(i)y_j$. This induces a clique of $2^(n-1)+1$ vertices ${pih_sigma(i)ihom(q)} union {pih_sigma(i)y_j : j in J}$ in $pih_(sigma(i))bcn$, which is impossible by @lem:clique-ext. We thus have that $pi_sigma(i) ihom(q) = pi_sigma(i)y_0 = ihom_i (pi_i x_0)$.
] 

Since for each $x_i in S_i$ there exists an $x in E$ with $pi_i x = x_i$, @lem:interior concludes our proof of @thm:factors.


== Applications to plasticity

We begin with a straightforward corollary of @thm:factors.

#theorem[(Banach)
  Let $Z := plus.circle.big_(i in [n]) X_i$ and let $ihom : B_Z -> B_Z$ be a non-contractive function. Then there is some permutation $sigma : [n] -> [n]$ and a family of non-contractive functions $ihom_i : S_i -> S_(sigma(i))$ such that for all points $x in B_Z$ and all $i in [n]$ we have 
  $pi_i x in S_i => pi_(sigma(i)) G(x) = ihom_i (pi_i x)$.
] <thm:banach-factors>

@thm:banach-factors follows from applying @thm:factors to the graph with vertices in $B_Z$, edges ${{x,x'} : norm(x-x')=2}$ and $ihom$ as the injective homomorphism.

This can be applied to prove some more natural theorems concerning plasticity.

#theorem[(Banach)
  Let $lip: B_Z -> B_Z$ be a 1-Lipschitz bijection. If $lip$ maps extreme points to extreme points, or $lip(S_Z) subset.eq S_Z$, then $lip$ is an isometry.
] <thm:natural>

// cite Leo here

We begin with some graph-theoretic lemmas mirroring the conditions of @thm:natural.

#lemma[
  If $S subset.eq ihom(S)$ or $E subset.eq ihom(E)$, then each $ihom_i$ is a bijection.
] <lem:bijective-factors>

Note that the conditions $S subset.eq ihom(S)$ and $E subset.eq ihom(E)$ in @lem:bijective-factors are equivalent to $lip(S) subset.eq S$ and $lip(E) subset.eq E$ respectively in the setting of @thm:natural.

#proof[
  It is enough to show that each $ihom_i$ is surjective, i.e. that $y in ihom_i (S_i)$ for any $y in S_(sigma(i))$.

  We shall first consider the case where $S subset.eq ihom(S)$.

  First, fix a point $q in S$ such that $pi_sigma(i) q = y$ and $pi_j q in.not S_j$ for all $j != sigma(i)$. By $S subset.eq ihom(S)$, we may fix $x in S$ such that $ihom(x) = q$. Let $J = {j in [n] : pi_j x in S_j}$. From @thm:factors, we know that $pi_sigma(j) ihom(x) in S_sigma(j)$ for all $j in J$. It follows that $J subset.eq {i}$. Since $x in S$, we have that $J$ is nonempty, from which $J = {i}$. This allows us to use @thm:factors to conclude that $ihom_i (pi_i x) = pi_sigma(i) ihom(x) = y$, so $y in ihom_i (S_i)$.

  We now consider the case where $E subset.eq ihom(E)$.

  Fix a point $q in E$ such that $pi_sigma(i) q = y$. Since $q in E$, there is some $x in E$ for which $ihom(x) = q$, and by @thm:factors, we have $ihom_i (pi_i x) = pi_sigma(i) ihom(x) = y$.
]

#lemma[
  On the assumptions of @lem:bijective-factors, $S subset.eq ihom(S)$ implies that $E subset.eq ihom(E)$.
]

#proof[
  Fix any point $y in E$. We aim to construct a point $x in E$ such that $ihom(x)=y$.

  By $S subset.eq ihom(S)$ and @lem:bijective-factors, we have that each $ihom_i$ is a bijection, so we may define $x$ such that $ihom_i (pi_i x) = pi_sigma(i) y$ for each $i in [n]$. By @thm:factors, we have that $pi_sigma(i) ihom(x) = ihom_i (pi_i x) = pi_sigma(i) y$, so $ihom(x) = y$ as desired.
]
  // I have no idea whether the converse holds - I should try
  // pushing the formalism at some point.

We now proceed with more geometric results for which a graph-theoretic analogue has not been recovered. Whenever @lem:bijective-factors is applicable, we define $lip_i = ihom_i^(-1)$ in analogy with the relation $lip = ihom^(-1)$.

#definition[
  Given a $1$-Lipschitz bijection $lip : B_Z -> B_Z$ and $ihom = lip^(-1)$ satisfying the conditions of @lem:bijective-factors, $ihom$ is said to be _homogeneous in $k$ components_ if, for all $J subset.eq [n]$ with $card(J) <= k$ and for all $x in B_Z$ such that $x$ has norm $1$ on components $[n] - J$, we have $forall i in [n], pi_sigma(i) ihom(x) = norm(pi_i x)ihom_i ((pi_i x)/norm(pi_i x))$, where the expression on the right-hand side is understood to be 0 whenever $norm(pi_i x) = 0$. Analogously, we say that $lip$ is homogeneous in $k$ components when, for the same $J$ and $x$, we have $forall i in [n], pi_(sigma^(-1)(i)) lip(x) = norm(pi_i x) lip_i ((pi_i x)/norm(pi_i x))$.
]
// This entire homogeneity business could use some reworking to have no reliance
// on a division by zero.
#lemma[(Banach)
  The function $ihom$ is homogeneous in $k$ components if and only if
  $lip$ is also.
]

#proof[
  We will show that $ihom$ being homogeneous in $k$ components implies that $lip$ is also. The proof in the opposite direction is analogous.

  Let us have $J subset.eq [n]$ with $card(J) <= k$ and $x in B_Z$ such that $x$ has norm 1 on components $[n] - J$.

  Fix any extreme point $y$ such that $pi_i x = alpha_i pi_i y$ for all $i in [n]$, where $alpha_i$ are non-negative scalars. (If $norm(pi_i x) > 0$ then $alpha_i = norm(pi_i x)$, otherwise $alpha_i = 0$ and $pi_i y$ can be arbitrary in $S_i$.)

  Define $q$ by $pi_i q = alpha_sigma(i) pi_i lip(y)$. Note that since $lip(y)$ is extreme, $q$ has just as many components of norm 1 as $x$ does. First, let us confirm that $ihom(q) = x$.

  By homogeneity, we have
  $ pi_sigma(i) ihom(q) = norm(pi_i q)ihom_i (pi_i lip(y)) = alpha_sigma(i) ihom_i (pi_i lip(y)). $

  Since $lip(y)$ is an extreme point, we also have that $pi_sigma(i) y = ihom_i (pi_i lip(y))$, hence

  $ pi_sigma(i) ihom(q) = alpha_sigma(i) pi_sigma(i) y = pi_sigma(i) x. $

  Since $ihom(q)$ and $x$ coincide on all components, we have $ihom(q) = x$, hence $q = lip(x)$.

  To prove that $lip$ is homogeneous in $k$ components, we need to show that
  $pi_(sigma^(-1)(i)) lip(x) = norm(pi_i x) lip_i ((pi_i x)/(norm(pi_i x)))$. Equivalently,
  we need to show that $pi_(sigma^(-1)) q = alpha_i lip_i (pi_i y)$. Since $pi_i y = ihom_(sigma^(-1)(i)) (pi_(sigma^(-1)(i)) lip(y))$ and $lip_i$ is the inverse of $ihom_(sigma^(-1)(i))$, we have $lip_i (pi_i y) = pi_(sigma^(-1)(i)) lip(y)$.
  Thus, it suffices to show that $pi_(sigma^(-1)(i)) q = alpha_i pi_(sigma^(-1)(i)) lip(y)$, which is equivalent to $pi_i q = alpha_(sigma(i)) pi_i lip(y)$, the way we defined $q$ earlier. Consequently we have that $lip$ is homogeneous in $k$ components.

#theorem[Suppose there are Banach spaces $X, Y$, and a non-expansive bijection $lip : B_X -> B_Y$ such that $lip$ is not an isometry. Then there is a Banach space $Z$ and a non-expansive bijection $induced : B_Z -> B_Z$ such that $induced$ is not an isometry.]

#proof[
  Let $C_i$ be a Banach space for each $i in ZZ$, such that $C_i = X$

  It is clear by inspection that the codomain of $induced$ is correct and that it is a non-expansive bijection. That it is not an isometry follows from considering the natural inclusions of two points $x, x' in C_(-1)$ into $Z$, where $norm(induced(x) - induced(x')) = norm(lip(x)-lip(x')) < norm(x-x')$.

#lemma[Let $X$ be a Banach space and let $A subset.eq X$ be closed under scaling by rationals. Then $clo(A sect B_X) = clo(A) sect B_X$.] <rat-scaling>

#proof[Since $A sect B_X subset.eq clo(A) sect B_X$ and the latter is closed, we have $clo(A sect B_X) subset.eq clo(A) sect B_X$. It thus suffices to show the opposite inclusion.

Fix any $a in clo(A) sect B_X$ and a sequence $a_i in A$ that converges to $a$. If $norm(a) < 1$, then $a_i in A sect B_X$ for all sufficiently large $i$, from which $a in clo(A sect B_X)$. If $norm(a) = 1$, then choose a sequence of rationals $q_i in QQ$ such that $abs(q_i) <= 1/norm(a_i)$ for all sufficiently large $i$, and $q_i -> 1$. This is possible since $norm(a_i) -> norm(a) = 1$. We then have $q_i a_i in A sect B_X$ for all sufficiently large $i$, and $q_i a_i -> a$, so $a in clo(A sect B_X)$. We thus have that $clo(A) sect B_X subset.eq clo(A sect B_X)$, so $clo(A) sect B_X = clo(A sect B_X)$.

#theorem[Let $X$ be a Banach space and $lip: B_X -> B_X$ be a non-expansive homeomorphism that is not an isometry. Then $X$ has a separable closed subspace $Y$ such that $lip(B_Y) = B_Y$ and $restr colon.eq lip|_B_Y : B_Y -> B_Y$ is a non-expansive homeomorphism that is not an isometry.]

#proof[
  Let $x, x' in B_X$ be points for which $norm(lip(x)-lip(x')) < norm(x-x')$.

  Define the set function $H colon 2^X -> 2^X$ as $ H(S) = lip(S sect B_X) union lip^(-1)(S sect B_X) union QQ dot S union (S+S). $ Note that $H(S)$ is countable whenever $S$ is countable, $S subset.eq H(S)$. Moreover, since $H$ is a union of set functions which are monotonic and continuous with respect to ascending chains of set inclusions, then $H$ is monotonic and continuous with respect to ascending chains also.

  Define $S_0 = {x,x'}$ and $S_(n+1) = H(S_n)$ for $n in NN$. Let $L = union.big_(n=0)^infinity S_n.$ Since $L$ is the limit of an ascending chain, we have $H(L) = union.big_(n=0)^infinity H(S_n) = union.big_(n=0)^infinity S_(n+1) = L$, so $L$ is a fixed point of $H$. Since $L$ is a countable union of countable sets, then $L$ is itself countable.

  Since $L$ is a fixed-point of $H$, we have that it is closed under addition and rational scaling, from which $clo(L)$ is closed under addition and real scaling, so $clo(L)$ is a closed subspace of $X$.
  Since $L$ is countable, $clo(L)$ is separable. By @rat-scaling,
  we have that $clo(L sect B_X) = clo(L) sect B_X = B_(clo(L))$.

  Since $lip$ is continuous and $L$ is closed under $lip$, we have
  that $lip(clo(L sect B_X)) subset.eq clo(lip(L sect B_X)) subset.eq clo(L sect B_X)$, so $lip(B_clo(L)) subset.eq B_clo(L)$. Analogously, we have $lip^(-1)(B_clo(L)) subset.eq B_clo(L)$. From these, we have $lip(B_clo(L)) = B_clo(L)$, so $restr$ is a well-defined non-expansive homeomorphism. Since $x, x' in B_clo(L)$, we also have that $restr$ is not an isometry.
